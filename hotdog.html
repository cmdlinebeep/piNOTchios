            Talk about easy.  When you make this, either the kids are requesting this or you are in desperate need of a break or a vacation.
            Maybe both.

            <b>Preparation</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Get out the hot dog from the fridge.

            <b>Steps</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Put the hot dog on a plate and into the microwave.  Turn on for 45 seconds or until you hear a greasy mess sputtering madly that you now have to
            clean up.  Put on plate.  Typically served with ketchup, but if you are feeling fancy, some yellow mustard will really spice things up.
