# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## PinNOTchio's Pizza
PiNOTchio's Pizza is designed to look like the website of a local pizzeria near Harvard.  I tried to mimic the bad design as best I could.  :-)

This project is written in the Django web framework and handles listing a pizza items menu and a shopping cart.  The site is responsive (though I don't demonstrate it on mobile here due to time).

My personal touch for the site was I added support for the Stripe API to process credit card payments.
