Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Quack

Quack is a spin on the popular messaging/chat/productivity/time-waster app, Slack.

I had fun with this assignment.  My big challenge to myself was to make the page look good on both desktop and mobile.  You be the judge, but I think it hits
that goal.  When the view is small, a vertical ellipsis icon expands the menu on mobile.  This menu can also be "dragged out" from the side.  

The personalization I added was the ability to Private Message.  I found this to be the most challenging part of my particular project.
